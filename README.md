## Hi there I'm JJ ðŸ‘‹

I like to dabble in different projects. Most of my projects have been in python and which I started to work on due to wanting to automate login processes using Selenium.

Right now my focus has been on making apps or using platforms like telegram to make systems that capture and disseminate user information, which I feel is the backbone of many apps today.
